* [Operating System Concepts _Tenth Edition_](https://os-book.com/OS10/index.html)<br>
This book help you to understand operating system concepts in details. 

## Week 00
1. [What is Operating Systems?](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-operating-systems/1/)<br>
Operating system is a software that manages all the components of the computer, including software and hardware. But, what exatcly they do?

## Week 01
1. [Linux Basic Command ](https://linuxopsys.com/topics/basic-linux-commands)<br>
Basic command in Linux that you need to know. This site is very helpful for beginners.

2. [Vim Commands](https://thevaluable.dev/vim-commands-beginner/)<br>
You should definitely check this tutorial first before using Vim.

3. [Regex](https://youtu.be/bgBWp9EIlMM)<br>
This video is suitable for you who are just going to learn about RegEx. This video is about 15 minutes only.

## Week 02

1. [Difference between Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption](https://www.trentonsystems.com/blog/symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption)<br>
A website that explains difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and how these security technologies work in the everyday secure of communication.

2. [GPG / PGP and How to Use It ?](https://www.privex.io/articles/what-is-gpg)<br>
A website that explains how to use GPG including generating key pair, exporting the public key, etc.

3. [RSA Encryption Algoritm](https://youtu.be/4zahvcJ9glg)<br>
This two-part video explains the mechanism behind the RSA encryption system.

## Week 03

1. [What is File System ?](https://www.howtogeek.com/196051/)<br>
A file system is simply the method by which an operating system manages its files. Similarly to file systems, each operating system has its own file system.

2. [Linux File Permission](https://www.howtogeek.com/67987/htg-explains-how-do-linux-file-permissions-work/)<br>
Linux has a straightforward file permissions system that is simple to grasp. Each user has a relationship with a file or directory based on whether they can see, write, or execute it.

3. [FUSE](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html)<br>
A userspace filesystem called Fuse has a mount utility in addition to a kernel module and userspace library. Non-privileged mount permitted with fuse.

4. [What is TAR File?](https://www.lifewire.com/tar-file-2622386)<br>
In Linux and Unix systems, TAR files are popular, however they are simply used for storing data, not for compressing it.

## Week 04

1. [Big and Little Endian Byte Order](https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-big-and-little-endian-byte-order/)<br>
This page describes the difference between data and numbers in addition to describing big and small endian. Examples are provided on this page so that they are easy to understand.

2. [Physical and Logical Address](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-physical-and-logical-address-space)<br>
A logical address created by the CPU is converted to a physical address in memory by the memory management unit (MMU).

3. [Paging and Segmentation](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/hardware/paging-and-segmentation/)<br>
Segmentation is a memory management approach in which each task is divided into a number of segments of various sizes, whereas paging divides process address space into blocks of the same size called pages.

4. [Declaring & Initializing Pointers in C](https://youtu.be/b3G9RjG4l2s)<br>
This video simply explain how to declare and initialize a pointers in C.

## Week 05

1. [Virtual Memory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
With the help of the storage allocation method known as virtual memory, secondary memory may be used as though it were a component of the main memory.

2. [Cache Memory in Computer Organization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cache-memory-in-computer-organization/)<br>
Small, temporary memory is known as cache memory. The main memory information or components that the CPU commonly accesses are kept in the cache memory so that the processor may quickly and readily access them.

3. [Memory Management in OS: Contiguous, Swapping, Fragmentation](https://www.guru99.com/os-memory-management.html)<br>
The article discusses memory management strategies, explains swapping, discusses memory allocation, and discusses paging, fragmentation, segmentation dynamic loading, and linking with variations from the static version.

4. [Thrashing in Operating System (OS)](https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2019/02/thrashing-in-operating-system-os.html)<br>
We must comprehend page faults and swapping, as the article states. They both have a connection to the thrashing process. When a page defect occurs more frequently and is followed by a greater rate of swapping, the operating system must spend more time swapping these pages.
